# Fishermen-Border-Alert-System
Increasing tension across the borders cause much conflicts among countries and India, Sri Lanka are no exception. The sea border between countries is not easily identifiable. The problem of Indian fishermen unintentionally crossing the border and getting abducted still remains unsolved. Further the inevitable harsh climate and the path misleading has cost many lives. On the basis of a census, so far in 2017, 215 Indian fishermen have been apprehended. About 30% of the fishermen family has lost their beloved ones. It tends to describe the role various surveillance technologies such as radar, unmanned aerial vehicles, satellites can play to avoid the chaos.  We can design an embedded system which notifies the fishermen about borders using GPS (global positioning system). We use GPS receiver to find the location of fishermen and the longitude, latitude values are sent to micro-controller. The fishermen are alerted few meters before the borders.On further moving the engine will stops.
